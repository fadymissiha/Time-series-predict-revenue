<p>Can we train the time-series model using the history of revenues to forecast and predict future revenues?

<p>This Data analytics study aims to prepare the history of revenues data and train the time-series model to predict and forecast future revenue.

<h3>Method Justification</h3>
<p>Assumptions: Data stationarity is the common assumption in time series, a stationary process has the property that the mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure do not change over time. Stationarity can be defined in precise mathematical terms, but for our purpose, we mean a flat-looking series, without trend, constant variance over time, a constant autocorrelation structure over time, and no periodic fluctuations. (NIST 2021)

<p>Autocorrelation is the coefficient of correlation between two values in the time series. (PSU 2021)
